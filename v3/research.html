                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Credit allowance to individuals who are seeking financial opportunities is vital for their growth and sustainability. Traditional credit scoring systems don’t allow them the privilege of getting personal loans, since individuals lack collateral or have a limited financial history. This paper approaches a novel solution that makes use of blockchain technology to overcome these issues and improve individuals' access to financing. The basic benefits of blockchain technology—transparency, security, and decentralization—have the potential to completely transform the credit rating system. By leveraging blockchain, we aim to develop a decentralized credit scoring system that incorporates a wide range of parameters including transaction history, social reputation, and other relevant factors. Moreover, the decentralized credit scoring system ensures data integrity and security, reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation in the credit scoring process.

                    <h4>Adoption of DevOps in Small to Medium
                        Enterprises (SMEs)</h4>
                    <p>Joint with <a href="https://faculty.daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/profile/swe/sadia.html" target="_blank">Farzana Sadia</a> and <a href="https://iub.ac.bd/faculties/mahady" target="_blank">Mahady Hasan, PhD</a> [<a href="#">On Going from June 2024</a>]

                    <p class="abstract">
                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The adoption of DevOps within Small and
                        Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) has gained attention as
                        businesses strive to enhance software development
                        efficiency and operational agility.This paper investigates
                        the challenges, methodologies, and outcomes of
                        implementing DevOps practices in SMEs, providing a
                        comprehensive analysis drawn from a mixed-methods
                        approach. By integrating qualitative insights from case
                        studies and interviews, alongside quantitative survey data,
                        the research highlights key strategies SMEs use to overcome
                        barriers in adopting DevOps. The findings reveal the
                        significant role of automation and collaboration in enabling
                        frequent and reliable system updates, while also pointing
                        out common challenges, such as the steep learning curve for
                        staff and the integration of toolchains to accelerate delivery.
                        The study further explores the intersection of structured
                        service management frameworks, such as ITIL, with Agile
                        and Lean practices, and how these facilitate smoother
                        transitions to DevOps in highly structured environments.
                        Ultimately, this research offers practical recommendations for SMEs on how to effectively embrace DevOps, emphasizing the importance of team ownership, flexible methodologies, and the ability to scale DevOps practices according to organizational needs . By shedding
                        light on both the potential benefits and hurdles of DevOps
                        adoption, this paper aims to contribute valuable insights for
                        both industry practitioners and academics focusing on
                        software development in SMEs.
